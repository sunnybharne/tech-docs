# 📖 Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Welcome to the **ADR repository**, where architectural decisions are documented, organized, and structured to align with best practices, governance, and business needs.

## 🏗 Well-Architected Framework  

The **Well-Architected Framework** provides a structured approach to designing secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient cloud infrastructure while balancing **cost and performance**.

### 🔹 Five Pillars of the Framework:
1. **Reliability** - Designing for fault tolerance and resilience.
2. **Security** - Protecting data, applications, and infrastructure.
3. **Cost Optimization** - Balancing performance with budget constraints.
4. **Operational Excellence** - Enabling efficient processes and automation.
5. **Performance Efficiency** - Optimizing resources and architecture.

**Key Principle:** Every design decision must balance across these five pillars.

---

## 📌 Layers of Decision-Making  

### 🎯 **Pillars → Design Principles → Specific Goals**  
- **Example: Design for Resilience**
  - Define the workload's tolerance for **downtime**.
  - Define the workload's tolerance for **data loss**.
  - Define the workload's tolerance for **performance degradation**.

### ✅ **Checklists for Architecture Decision-Making**
- Identify **critical user and system flows** in your workload.
- Perform **Failure Mode Analysis (FMA)** to identify risks.
- Define **reliability and recovery targets** (RTO, RPO).
- Map decisions to **relevant cloud design patterns**.

## 📝 **Architecture Documentation Checklist**
A well-documented architecture should include the following:

1️⃣ **Workload Architecture Design Specification**
   - A detailed document that justifies design choices with diagrams.
   - Must address functional and non-functional requirements.

2️⃣ **Workload Architectural Design Diagram**
   - Visual representation of the architecture.

3️⃣ **Functional Specification**
   - **What & Why** of the system (not how).
   - Defines the problem statement, expected solution, and impact.
   - Topics include **scope, user flows, accessibility, compliance, performance, privacy, and security**.

4️⃣ **Technical Specification**
   - **How** the system or feature is built.
   - Covers **technology choices, API contracts, rollout plans, monitoring strategies, and alternative designs**.

5️⃣ **Disaster Recovery Plan**
   - Ensures system recovery within **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** and **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**.
   - Includes **failover, backup, restore, and data replication** strategies.

6️⃣ **Security & Compliance Documentation**
   - Covers policies, risk assessments, and controls.

7️⃣ **Consistency in Documentation**
   - Use templates and include the following:
     - **State:** Draft, In Review, Approved.
     - **Work Item Link:** Reference to the backlog item.
     - **Key Individuals:** Decision-makers (e.g., Architect, Product Owner).
     - **Cross-Links:** Related specifications for reference.

## 📊 **Design Diagrams**
Different types of diagrams used in architecture decisions:

- **System Diagram (High-Level Architecture)**
- **Block Diagram (Component-Based)**
- **Deployment Diagram**
- **Dataflow Diagram**
- **Sequence Diagram (Interaction Flows)**
- **User Flow Diagram**
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
- **Network Diagram**
- **State Diagram**
- **Flowcharts**

## 🔖 **Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Guidelines**
To maintain consistency across ADRs:

- Use a **standardized template** for every decision.
- Include the following:
  - **Problem Statement & Context**
  - **Options Considered**
  - **Decision Outcome**
    - Trade-offs made.
    - Confidence level in the decision.
- **Break large decisions into multiple records** if they span multiple phases (short-term, mid-term, long-term).
- **Be transparent** about risks and trade-offs.
- **Keep it concise** – ADRs are not design guides but should be self-explanatory.

📌 **Storage:** ADRs should be kept in the same repository as the workload's documentation (e.g., GitHub, Confluence).

---

## 🤝 **Collaboration & Workload Team Coordination**
- **Provide clarity** on architecture decisions.
- **Review implementation checkpoints** to track progress.
- **Communicate with stakeholders** regularly.
- **Recommend appropriate environments** (e.g., PreProd).
- **Use Proof of Concept (PoC)** before finalizing decisions.

### **Workloads & Components**
- A single application architecture can contain **multiple workloads**.
- Every workload undergoes **Component & Topology Design**.
- **Azure Architects** are responsible for **component and topology design**.

---

## 📌 **Decision-Making Framework**
- **Log every architectural decision**.
- Evaluate decisions based on:
  - **Limitations, constraints, trade-offs, efforts, reversibility, and risks**.
  - Use **decision trees and feature matrices** as guidance (but rely on expert judgment).
- **Justify every decision** in documentation.

---

## 🌐 **Cloud Design Patterns**
- Leverage existing **Cloud Design Patterns** for scalability, resilience, and efficiency.
- Avoid **design cliffs** and anticipate future **growth**.

---

## 🚀 **Forward-Thinking Architecture**
- **Change is expensive after implementation**—design with flexibility.
- Consider:
  - **Future scaling needs**
  - **Compliance changes**
  - **Multi-region deployments**
  
---

## 🛠 **Design for Supportability**
- **Cloud Provider Support**
- **Operational Visibility**
- **Customer Support Capabilities**

---

# 🏛 **TOGAF (The Open Group Architectural Framework)**  
The **Architect’s Role**:
- Design, deliver, and plan while translating **functional & non-functional** requirements into **cloud design patterns**.
- Ensure the design is:
  - **Operationally sound** (observability, supportability, disaster recovery).
  - **Cost-effective & scalable**.
  - **Aligned with business, financial, compliance, and organizational constraints**.

---
